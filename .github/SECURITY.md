## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### For Critical/High Severity Issues:
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly at [your-security-email] with details
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### For Low/Medium Severity Issues:
1. Create a GitHub issue using the security template
2. Mark it with the `security` label
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

## Response Timeline

- **Critical/High**: We aim to respond within 24 hours
- **Medium**: We aim to respond within 72 hours  
- **Low**: We aim to respond within 1 week

## Security Best Practices

### Backend Security
- All API endpoints use proper validation
- CORS is configured appropriately
- Input sanitization is implemented
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Dependencies are regularly updated via Dependabot

### Frontend Security
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- XSS protection is implemented
- Dependencies are regularly updated via Dependabot
- Environment variables are used for configuration
- HTTPS is enforced in production

### Infrastructure Security
- Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- Secrets are managed through GitHub Secrets
- Least privilege access is maintained
- Regular security updates are applied

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Currently uses anonymous access for simplicity
- Future versions will implement proper authentication
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) planned for future releases

### Data Protection
- Input validation on all forms
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- CORS configuration limits cross-origin requests
- No sensitive data is logged

### Monitoring & Logging
- Application Insights integration for monitoring
- Error logging without sensitive data exposure
- Audit trails for critical operations

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- Dependabot checks for vulnerable dependencies
- Container image scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Static code analysis planned for future implementation

### Manual Security Testing
- Regular security reviews
- Penetration testing for major releases
- Code reviews with security focus

## Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
2. Provide regular updates on the investigation
3. Credit researchers who report vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
4. Coordinate disclosure timeline with reporters

## Contact Information

For security-related inquiries:
- Email: [your-security-email]
- GitHub: Create a security issue with appropriate labeling

For general questions about this security policy:
- Create a regular GitHub issue
- Tag with `security` and `question` labels

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. We will:
- Announce significant changes via GitHub releases
- Update the policy version and date
- Maintain backwards compatibility for existing processes
